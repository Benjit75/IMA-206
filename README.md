# IMA-206: Generative networks, patch-based methods and computational photography
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course IMA-206 at Télécom Paris 

This course consists of two parts.

It first offers a methodological part focusing on two central tools in image restoration and editing: patch methods and generative neural networks. The patch methods are based on the postulate that the local neighborhoods of the digital images (the patches) exhibit self-similarity properties that can be exploited to improve the quality of the images. Generative networks (auto-encoders, generative adversary networks) allow the improvement or synthesis of images, from training sessions on large databases.

In a second part, the course presents several applications from the field of computational photography, which consists of overcoming the limitations of imaging devices by algorithmic means. The two methodological approaches seen initially will be implemented in this context.

The following applications will be detailed:
- High dynamic range (HDR) imaging
- Image deconvolution
- Inpainting
